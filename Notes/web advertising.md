--------Advertisers vs Publishers----------

1. Advertiser – the content provider and offer owner
2. Publisher – the traffic provider and the one who’s responsible for the ad (Websites)

There are also Affiliate Networks, an intermediary between Advertisers and Publishers

An advertiser is the one who pays to get his ad shown on different websites. Usually, it’s a company that has a product and connects with publishers to promote an ad through their websites. A publisher is a person or a company that’s in charge of connecting the advertiser’s product with the end user, as they are the traffic provider. There're different types of publishers.

For instance, media buyers – they buy their traffic on ad networks, webmasters (blog owners etc) who have their own organic traffic from web pages, social marketers, who are the folks gathering their traffic using social networks.

For example, when visiting different websites you may find offers like "50% off to get a subscription to programming courses'' or "new book released" and so on and so forth. In most cases, it would illustrate that you're visiting publisher's website with an ad promotion from an advertiser. 

----------Google Advertising Platforms----------

1. AdSense Is for Website Publishers, AdWords Is for Businesses
The fundamental difference between AdWords and AdSense is who they’re designed for. AdWords is for advertisers and AdSense is for publishers, or website owners.

AdWords enables businesses and marketers to advertise on Google’s network (search, display, etc).
 

AdSense enables publishers to reserve space for AdWords placements on their website (text, video, images).
 

Both AdWords and AdSense work together to complete Google’s greater advertising network: website owners put up space for Google’s ads (AdSense) and businesses set budgets and ads to display on Google’s advertising network (AdWords).

----------Audience Planner + Content Segments--------------

 - Generating Audience Reports - The core functionality of Audience Planner helps publishers identify where on their properties a particular audience persona lives to facilitate higher-quality RFP responses. The fact that reports are generated within minutes means you can respond more quickly -- or spend time crafting your strategy instead of chasing data.
 
 - Content Segments - The true power of Audience Planner is unlocked with the metadata tagging structure in Content Segments. Content Segments enable publishers to drill down to the article, author or event content topic and see where a particular audience is living on your properties.
 
------------PUBLISHER CAMPAIGN REPORTING------------

 - Tracking KPI-driven Campaigns - In today’s competitive environment, publishers need to be able to prove the reach and composition of audiences they’ve sold to advertisers. Publisher Campaign Reporting allows publishers to easily mirror personas created in Audience Planner, to facilitate mid-flight and post campaign reporting.
 
 - Top Audience Insights - In addition to validating the audience you promised, Publisher Campaign Reporting provides insights on the top audiences responding to a particular campaign. This is particularly useful to publishers because it helps them to either:
 
 1. Identify opportunities to extend the reach of an underperforming campaign OR
 2. Deliver new audience insights that can be used to further engage the advertisers, which could lead to renewals or new business opportunities
 
 - Line Item Compare - Line Item Compare allows publishers to directly compare the audiences for two different items in your media plan -- that could be campaigns, brands or even creative types -- and explore similarities / differences between those audiences.
