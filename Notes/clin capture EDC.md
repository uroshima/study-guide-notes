An electronic data capture (EDC) system is a computerized system designed for the collection of 
clinical data in electronic format for use mainly in human clinical trials. EDC replaces 
the traditional paper-based data collection methodology to streamline data collection and 
expedite the time to market for drugs and medical devices. EDC solutions are widely adopted 
by pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (CRO).
Typically, EDC systems provide:

 - a graphical user interface component for data entry
 - a validation component to check user data
 - a reporting tool for analysis of the collected data
 
EDC systems are used by life sciences organizations, broadly defined as the pharmaceutical,
medical device and biotechnology industries in all aspects of clinical research, but
are particularly beneficial for late-phase (phase III-IV) studies and pharmacovigilance 
and post-market safety surveillance.

EDC can increase the data accuracy and decrease the time to collect data for studies of drugs and 
medical devices. The trade-off that many drug developers encounter with deploying an EDC system to 
support their drug development is that there is a relatively high start-up process, followed by 
significant benefits over the duration of the trial. As a result, for an EDC to be economical 
the saving over the life of the trial must be greater than the set-up costs. This is often aggravated 
by two conditions:

1. That initial design of the study in EDC does not facilitate the decrease in costs over the life 
of the study due to poor planning or inexperience with EDC deployment
2. Initial set-up costs are higher than anticipated due to initial design of the study in EDC
 due to poor planning or experience with EDC deployment.
 
 The EDC landscape has continued to evolve from its evolution from RDE in the late 1990s. Today, the market consists of a variety of new and established software providers. Many of these providers offer specialized solutions targeting certain customer profiles or study phases. Modern features of EDC now include features like cloud data storage, role-based permissions, and case report form designers[1], as well as clinical trials analytics, interactive dashboards, and electronic medical record integration.
 
 ----------Future----------
 In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced its eSource guidance, which suggests methods of capturing clinical trial data electronically from the very beginning and moving it to the cloud, as opposed to EDC's more traditional method of capturing data initially on paper and transcribing it into the EDC system. Adoption of eSource was initially slow, with the FDA producing a webinar in July 2015 to further promote the guidance. Efforts like the TransCelerate eSource Initiative (in 2016) have been founded "to facilitate the understanding of the eSource landscape and the optimal use of electronic data sources in the industry to improve global clinical science and global clinical trial execution for stakeholders. A 2017 study by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development suggested that with the following three years a "majority of [surveyed clinical information] companies" (growing from 38 percent to 84 percent) planned to incorporate eSource data. With 87 percent of research sites (2017) stating that eSource would be "helpful" or "very helpful" if integrated with today's EDC[12], a shift away from EDC (or EDC taking a more complementary role) may be possible.
 
 ------------Who uses EDC software?------------

Today, the majority of clinical trials being initiated use electronic data capture software. There are three primary categories of EDC software users: sites, sponsors, and CROs:

1. Sites – A site refers to the entity that coordinates and collects data from the clinical trial patients, or subjects; usually a hospital or clinic. Nurses or other designated study “coordinators” employed by the site will typically be tasked with entering data into the study’s EDC system. The site’s Investigator—the physician in charge of the patient’s care and patient’s data–is responsible for reviewing and electronically signing the data.

2. Sponsor – The sponsor of a clinical trial is the organization that “owns” the trial. Biopharma, device, and other life sciences companies must sponsor clinical trials in order to get their medical innovations approved by regulatory authorities (like the FDA) before they can go to market with their product. Sponsors may employ a variety of people who use the EDC system in various roles. Monitors working on behalf of the sponsor may visit the client sites to review data source documents and verify the accuracy of corresponding data in the EDC system (with EDC software this “visit” is often virtual). Biostatisticians help plan for and analyze data collected. Typically heavy users of EDC software, data managers have the responsibility is to ensure the trial data is clean and usable. Among other tasks, they may submit requests for information (called “queries”) to the sites to clarify and resolve data issues.

3. CRO – A CRO, or contract research organization, is an entity that contracts with Sponsors to facilitate the planning and conduct of a clinical trial. In some trials, the CROs may effectively operate the trial on behalf of the sponsor. In other trials, they will take on only some of the key roles (data management, monitoring, analysis). In this regard, CROs may have many of the same types of EDC system users as sponsors. In academia, CROs are often called AROs (Academic Research Organizations), Clinical Trials Units, or Data Coordinating Centers. Their coordinating and management functions are much the same as their commercial counterparts.

In addition to the above types of EDC users, study patients may also contribute data to the EDC system, either directly through a specialized role in the software, or via a separate device and/or application that transmits data to the EDC system. The practice of patients entering data is called ePRO (electronic patient reported outcomes).

----------Trends in EDC------------

In the 1990s electronic data capture was referred to “remote data capture” (RDC). Compared to today’s technologies, these systems were quite archaic, often built an a client-server architecture involving a thick that sometimes took the form of a specialized device, as opposed to an every-day PC. These systems were essentially data “silos” that had no easily ability to interchange their data with other systems.

Today, the integration of EDC software with other types of software in the eClinical spectrum (randomization, supply management, adverse event reporting, coding, submissions, etc.) systems is increasingly feasible and beneficial. The ability to quickly and reliably import electronic data from other sources (such as lab reports, imaging data sources, and electronic health records) is also becoming commonplace. The rise of open source EDC software and independent standards for characterizing and sharing data (like CDISC) are key enablers towards accelerating the productivity and decreasing the cost and burden associated with clinical trials.

--------------What are common features of an EDC system?------------

Most software vendors are continually developing new enhancements to keep up with changes in the industry. While the bells and whistles vary from system to system, there is some functionality that you’ll find in just about every EDC solution.

- eCRF Designer. When creating eCRFs, there are design options to choose from that are meant to imitate paper forms. Forms are saved in a library and can often be used across multiple protocols. This eliminates the need to recreate commonly used forms and promotes data standards. When building forms, edit checks can be programmed to help prevent invalid data from being entered. This can ensure that the values entered meet certain requirements.

- Data Entry. After a protocol is set up in the system, the data that was collected is entered into the appropriate forms.

- Query Management. An EDC system provides streamlined communication between monitors, data managers and coordinators. Most systems have auto-generated queries and the ability to manually add queries. All queries need to be responded to and resolved by different roles before the data can be locked.

- Data Export. Once you’re ready to pull the data out of the system, there are easily accessible exports to extract patient data. Some systems have built-in metrics reporting that offer insights into the progress of a study.

-------------What's ePRO?---------------

The practice of patients entering data is called ePRO (electronic patient reported outcomes).

-------------What's CRF?------------------

A case report form is a paper or electronic questionnaire specifically used in clinical trial research. The case report form is the tool used by the sponsor of the clinical trial to collect data from each participating patient.

------------What's CTMS?--------------------

CTMS (Clinical Trial Management System) – the clinical trial management platform
A CTMS is a software designed to address the inefficiencies on the management and operational sides of research, consisting of different tools like site selection and monitoring, patient recruitment, contact management, financial management, and regulatory document tracking. It focuses on the operational oversight of the study itself. CTMS contributes in the conduction of a clinical trial, however it does not focus on data collection.

-------------What's eSource?-------------------

eSource simply means the electronic data is the source data. In other words, eSource is not a mobile app or fancy new feature, but it is the way of collecting data in which the data is entered directly into the electronic record. Therefore, those who are interested in eSource may wish to choose an Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  system which is optimized for this method.
