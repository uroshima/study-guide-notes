Why are media queries useful?
For styling on different types of devices, certain parts of the design will behave differently depending on the size of the screen

What is mobile-first design? Be as specific as possible.
Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices). Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px.

CSS Flexbox
What is the default value of align-items in the flex world?
It is stretch

Explain the syntax flex: 1, flex: 2, etc.
If we have a couple of columns, flex: 2 means that column is gonna be 2 times bigger than the one with flex: 1.

Explain flex-wrap
In case of smaller screens, we use flex-wrap: wrap so the columns don't change their size but instead reorganize them in multiply rows.
